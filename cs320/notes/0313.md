- identifiers = names of variables. (and function, parameter, field, method, class...)
- binding occurrence - identifier occurs to be **defined**
- bound occurrence - identifier occurs to **use the entity** related to itself
  - any bound occurence must reside in the scope of the binding occurrence.
- free identifier - neither binding nor bound
- shadowing: innermost binding occurrence shadows the outer binding occurrences of the same time.

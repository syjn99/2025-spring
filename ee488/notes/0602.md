## Why Cellular vulnerabilities?

- standard pretty complicated.
- government not patching....
- nobody attackers.. (so far)

- Cellular Metasploit?
  - open source attacker
- private 5G...
- paging: question "Are you here?"
  - ask multiple cell towers (이동 중일 수 있기 때문)
  - use temporary identifier(TMSI) (~= but not temporary)
- GUTI reallocation
  - but just few bytes changed...
  - even though some operators change it randomly -> but after 10 times it is fixed!
- emergency -> Without authentication.
  - spoof!

[Lecture Note 2](../lecture-notes/Lec2.pdf)

- hw -> use chat gpt
- you can always get over 100% with extra credits

## Divisiblity

- definition is most important
- `16 | 0` -> yes!

## Proof Techniques

- **Most HW, Quiz will give some prove/disprove questions**

- Direct Proof vs Indirect Proof(대우, contrapositive)
- Proof by contradiction: Euclid's proof
  - There are infinitely many prime numbers.
  - -> Say that there are finite numbers that are prime
  - -> p1, p2, ... pk
  - -> then n = p1 p2 ... pk + 1 -> n is composite
  - p_j | n -> but p_j | p1...pk -> contradiction ( * )!
```plaintext
~(p => q) == ~(~p or q) == p and ~q
```
- Proof by cases -> n = 2k, n = 2k + 1
- Existence proof -> constructive vs nonconstructive
  - constructive: exists x that satisfies x^2 = 1 
  - nonconstructive: we cannot actually find, e.g. calculus, existence of gcd
- Universal Proof: for all
- Uniqueness proof/Induction
- Backwards reasoning -> arithmetric mean vs geometric mean
  - sometimes get idea by using backwards reasoning. should check if coming back is fine

### Divisibility

- if a|b and b|c => a|c: Direct Proof

### Quotient and remainder

- show that for any integer n, n^2 cannot be of the form 3k + 2 => divide n by 3, **Proof by cases**

### Existence of GCD

- Extended Eucledean Algorithm => `O(log(max(a, b)))`

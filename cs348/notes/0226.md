## Computer Security

- **Vulnerability**
  - gain access to private data/full control of a machine

### CIA Triad

- CIA: Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability
  - **C**: avoidance of the unauthorized disclosure of information
    - by Encryption, Access control, Authentication
    - Authentication: determine of the identity or role
      - sth you are(fingerprint), sth you know(password), sth you have(device, id card...)
      - 2FA - literally two factor
    - Access Control: = policy/rule
      - different user/level
      - e.g. Linux file system
  - **I**: Benign/Malicious compromise
    - periodically **backup**
    - **checksums**: original data + additional field to calculate the integrity
  - **A**: system is useless if it is not available

### AAA Triad

- AAA(modern, newly emerging): Assurance(보장성), Authenticity(진위여부), Anonymity(익명)
  - Assurance: **is service provider trustful**/does the service provide the promised service?/can user use without paying?
    - Policy, Permission, Protection
    - Different from **CIA**
  - Authenticity: how to determine the statements/policies/permissions are genuine?
    - fake commitment
    - **Nonrepudation**: check if this statement cannot be denied
      - e.g. digital signature
  - Anonimity: certain records/txs are not to be **attributable** to any individual
- By composing different tables -> annonimized can be broken

### Examples

- Eavesdropping (도청) -> ensuring `Confidentiality`
- Alteration (변조) -> `Integrity`
- Denial-of-service: `Availability`
- Masquerading (위장)/Repudiation (시치미): `Authentication`, `Access Control`
- Correlation and traceback (추적) -> `Anonymity`

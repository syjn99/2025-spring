# CS320 - Programming Language (A+)

> Instructor: Sukyoung Ryu

Learn how to design a programming language with a cumulative approach. All lectures are uploaded on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/instructor/~34120603). [Textbook](https://hjaem.info/itpl) was written by the instructor.

## Features

- Main topic: Functional programming, Interpreter, Type checking, Continuation
- Mostly used [**Scala**](https://www.scala-lang.org/) to build the interpreters and type checkers. All assignments and projects are [public](https://github.com/kaist-plrg-cs320/assignment-docs).

## What I learnt

- **Functional programming**: Although I loved the concept that functional programming provides, this course made me understand an academic background of itself. The approach was great: students can learn by adding new features from the most minimalized language. Most of the problems require to write static and dynamic semantics of new language features, and those were quite familiar as they are mostly inspired by modern programming languages. Lambda calculus was also an interesting topic, as all of the features of modern programming languages can be **desugared** by very basic set of expressions.
- Little bit of Scala skills: Writing a code with Scala was quite fun.

[Lecture Note 8](../lecture-notes/Lecture%208%20Slides.pdf)

- Access control -> important for OS b/c it manages resource.
- especially for resource sharing
- principle: least privilege
  - don't unnecessarily give other permission
- WHO has access to various information
- achieve AC in cyber world = we need **reference monitor**.
  - check if subject(user, software...) can perform an operation on an object(resource)
  - properties
    - complete mediation: if operation is invoked, must be invoked
    - small: good performance
    - tamper-proof: policy should not be altered
- Two type of policy
  - DAC (Discretionary): all object has owner, and owner decides.
  - MAC (Mandatory): only admin can decide.
    - SELinux: security-enhanced linux
- access control matrix -> **ACL** (object-centered)
- autograder e.g -> since everyone wants to submit through autograder.
  - only autograder relies on file name.
  - **confused deputy problem**: slack, android, OS X
  - https://cyber0946.tistory.com/53
- deputy(autograder) -> merge two different permission (from prof & from student2)
  - so based on the master, the path should be **DIFFERENT**
- ambient authority (자동 부여 권한)
  - object = designated by its name only.
  - but it's easy to use. balance btw **usability** and security
  - -> solution: subject permission needed. (certificate)
- **capability-based approach** (subject-centered)
  - e.g. open syscall -> whenever call open, then OS will check that you(subject) are permissioned to have the given privilege
  - file descriptor is like **ticket**
  - <grade.txt, w> will not be issued to student2.
  
- directly typing in the cli -> ACL
- write a program -> always need ticket -> capabilities

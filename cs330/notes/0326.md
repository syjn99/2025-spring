[Lecture Note 5](../lecture-notes/05-synchronization.pdf)

- concurrent thread programming -> many benefit but critical issue: shared data. (unpredictable, non-deterministic)
  - must be insensitive to arbitrary interleavings, but...
- Let's delve into synchronization methods

## Lock

> prevents someone from doing something.

- lock before entering critical section -> unlock(release) when leaving
- how to implement entry/exit part???
- and why there are so many solutions? -> to solve the problem of previous one.

## Too much milk problem

- simple approach: use a note (Solution #1)
```
if (noMilk) {
    if (noNote) {
        leave Note;
        buy milk;
        remove Note;
    }
}
```
-> too much milk can happen occasionally.

- thread A can be switched right after checking milk and note,
- then context switch to B, also check note and milk
- then A preempt, leave note, buy milk
- B preempt -> leave note, buy milk
- -> make problem worse since it fails intermittenly...

- early note (Solution #2)

```
leave note A;
if (noNote B) {
    if (noMilk) {
        buy milk;
    }
}
remove note A;
```

```
leave note B;
if (noNote A) {
    if (noMilk) {
        buy milk;
    }
}
remove note B;
```

-> problem: no milk..!
- thread A leave note A, then switch to B
- B leave note B,
- A checks note from B, end up with both not buying milk.
- **Starvation**

- two-note solution (Solution #3)
```
leave note A;
while (note B) {
    do nothing;
}
if (noMilk) {
    buy milk;
}
remove note A;
```

```
leave note B;
if (noNote A) {
    if (noMilk) {
        buy milk;
    }
}
remove note B;
```

-> this works!
- ensure 1) safe to buy 2) other will buy, ok to quit
- but this is unsatisfactory
  - short code but too complex.
  - A and B has different code. -> not scalable
  - A keeps waiting: **busy waiting**
- -> *we need higher level implementation* (e.g. higher level atomic operations, then load/store)

## Lock again

- Wrap the critical section with Acquire/Release 
- But how can we implement this operation?!

### Naive

- when do we have tricky/problematic switch? -> dispatcher works.
- But what if we just disable dispatcher, that means turn off interrupt.
  
```
LockAcquire { disable Ints; }
LockRelease { enable Ints; }
```

- mutual exclustion: no race condition!!! only one thread in critical section
- but drawback
  - one program may acquire lock, and run infinite loop -> never preempted!! this program will run forever.
    ```
    LockAcquire();
    While (TRUE) {;}
    ```
  - system-wide deadlock.
  - I/O -> send some interrupt to report, but what if interrupt is disabled? DISASTER.

### Better

- disable and enable interrupts only inside Acquire/Release.

```
int lock = 0; // FREE

Acquire() {
    disable interrupts;
    if (lock == BUSY) {
        put thread on wait queue;
        Go to sleep();
    } else {
        lock = BUSY;
    }
    enable interrupts
}

Release() {
    disable interrupts;
    if (anyone on wait queue) {
        take thread off wait queue;
        Place on ready queue;
    } else {
        lock = FREE;
    }
    enable interrupts
}
```

- can we enable interrupt before putting thread on the wait queue?
  - Release function may not work correctly.
  - if other thread preempted right before `put thread on wait queue` -> lock can become `FREE`. this thread can go to sleep FOREVER.
- can we put enable interrupts right after `put thread on wait queue`?
  - `Release` put the thread on the ready queue. -> then go to sleep, even holding the lock. == Deadlock.

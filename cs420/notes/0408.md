p 92 - key metrics of optimizations

- cf. fast-math mode: apply associativity in floaing point operations
- compiler writers -> "craft" the sequence of optimization steps

p 50 -> SSA

%x = %y + 42

- we know everywhere will have same value from SSA property.
- flow sensitivity -> SSA로 인해 achieve flow-sensitivity for free!

  - analysis gonna be fast and precise.
- undefined behavior -> bad but it is necessary for opt
  - e.g. 
```c
void f() {
    int a = 42;
    g();
    print(a);
}
```

```c
void f() {
    int a = 42;
    g();
    print(42); // const prop
}
```
-> but what if `g` changes `a`? -> we can corrupt `a` as stack grows downward.
  - this is undefined behavior

p119 - compiler correctness

- semantic preversation: target set of behavior is subset of a source set of behavior
  - only external visible behavior is of concern.

```c
void foo() {
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i)
        print(i)
}

void main() {
    if (SOME_NONDETERMINISTIC_VALUE)
        foo();
}
```

- two possible set: (1) print 0 to 9, (2) do nothing
- if a program has undefined behavior -> a program can do anything: [p] = T (for top, set of all behavior)
- compiler can choose.

[Lecture Note](../lecture-notes/03-process.pdf)

## Design

- Performance is most important factor.
  - Solution: use multiprogramming
- Virtual machine abstraction -> give illusion to each app.
- program vs. process
  - process: active entity, program: passive entity

## PCB (Process Control Block)

- state of runtime process. (= snapshot)
- contains:
  - pc, cpu registers
  - process state, scheduling info
  - memory management
  - i/o status
  - credentials
  - accounting statistics

## Context Switch

- we use this in **context switching**
  - who does context switch -> OS
- Preemption
  - running process can pass control to kernel: e.g. syscall, page fault.
  - interrupt (periodic timer): e.g. round robin
  - device interrupt
- it is overhead

## Lifecycle

- `new`: process is being created
  - contruct new PCB
  - create new address space: expensive
  - if forked -> copy data from parent: very expensive
    - memory space consists of code, static data(global data), heap, stack
    - we simply copy the memory space of parent to child process
    - also even PC and SP(stack pointer)

e.g. fork syscall
```c
int main() {
    int pid;

    pid = fork();
    if (pid < 0>) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Fork Failed"); exit(-1);
    } else if (pid == 0) {
        printf("Child: I am %d. My parent is %d.\n", getpid(), getppid());
    } else {
        printf("Parent: I am %d. My child is %d.\n", getpid(), pid);
    }
}
```

- `ready`: put into ready queue, waiting to be executed
- `running`: execute.
- `waiting`: when `running` process has to wait on I/O or event.

### Termination

- syscall: `exit`.
  - last statement and asks OS to delete all. (deallocation)
  - output status data for parent.
    - parent process can read status via `wait`
- `abort`: parent process can terminate child.

## Cooperating process and Resource Protection

- Multi-process architecture
- e.g. Chrome Browser
  - Browser process: user interface, disk, network I/O
  - Renderer process: renders web pages, HTML, JS for each website.
    - Runs in Sandbox. restrict disk and network I/O(system resourcesxw)
    - For safety. protect our system.
  - Plug-in process
  - similar to OS <-> App.
    - App doesn't have ability to request network directly; must request through OS
- shared memory(syscall: `shmget`, `shmdt`)
  - how process B knows the `id` of shared memory segment?
  - Process A -> parent, Process B -> child
  - A can do fork at this moment -> Process B can be shared. (copy of `id` variable)
    - fork semantic works!

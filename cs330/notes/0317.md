## Scheduling

- Scheduler: High-level **policy** -> decide which process to run
  - `ChooseNextThread()`
- Dispatcher: Low-level **machanism** -> context switch
  - infinite loop

```
Loop {
    RunThread();
    ChooseNextThread();
    SaveStateOfCPU(curTCB);
    LoadStateOfCPU(newTCB);
}
```

- CPU burst - time for use of CPU execution, I/O burst -> time for I/O operation
  - majority of CPU burst -> shorter than 6 ms.

### Criteria

- improve CPU utilization(CPU is quite expensive resource)
- reduce waiting time of process

### Algorithms

#### FCFS(First-Come, First-Served)

- 선착순
- different if arriving order differs.
- when shore process wait behind long process -> avg waiting time becomes longer

#### SJF(Shortest-Job-First)

- schedule the process with the shortest time (use CPU burst time)
- **optimal** in terms of minimizing avg waiting time.
- but we don't know exactly about the next CPU burst time.
  -> we may estimate/approximate
  - one-time unit, if not finished, then preempt another process. -> RR

#### RR(Round Robin)

- each process -> samll unit of CPU time(time quantum)
- after time elapsed, process is preempted, push back to the ready queue
- if time quantum very large -> FIFO ~= FCFS
  - small -> high context switch overhead.

#### Priority Scheduling

- each process has priority number
- CPU will allocate with the highest priority
- SJF: priority == predicted next CPU burst time
- Problem: **Starvation**
  - some process may never execute
- Solution: **Aging**
  - increases the priority as time goes by

#### Multilevel Queue

- multiple queues. each queue has diff scheduling policy
  - some FCFS, some RR (time quantum can also be differed)
- High level scheduler can also schedule **between** queues -> we may use priority. Q0 > Q1 > Q2
- favor
  - short cpu bursts
    - majority of process will be finished in the first Q0(time quantum = 8 ms)
  - I/O bound -> keep using higher priority queue
  - interactive

### For multiple-processor

- decide which CPU to run it.
  - CPU switch(migration) > very expensive
    - more cache/TLB(Translation Lookaside Buffer) misses
- we have to analyze when deciding to migrate or not.
- Affinity.

## Priority Inversion

- higher priority -> more important/urgent
- but there is some unexpected situation -> what if lower priority task blocks the higher priority task?
  - lower task acquire the lock, but higher task wants to acquire the lock.
- **Priority Donation**!

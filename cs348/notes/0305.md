## Classical

- codes: to keep **confidentiality**
- art: (pure) art. only smart person can develop and use cryptography
  - modern: based on science and math -> everyone can understand. (**demotcratized**)

### Caesar

- enumerate every possible cases (n = 26): exhaustive key search

### Substitution

- shifting is not very robust, just 1-1 mapping
- permutation: key space is `26!`. ( = `4 * 10^26`) => very large
- but we have frequency for each letter, random mapping **doesn't change** the distribution

### Vigenere (비즈네르 암호)

- same plaintext, diff ciphertext
- key: a -> 0, b -> 1.... and shift with this key
- **if we know key length**
  - divide ciphertext into `t` parts, apply statistical analysis
- **if unknown, but max length of key(`T`) is known**
  - Repeat `T` times
- **if we don't know anything about length**
  - analysis repeating substring: if in plaintext -> **may** exists in ciphertext
  - distance of two occurences -> may be a multiple of the key length
    - we can guess the key length could be a factor of the distance.
- properties of Kasiski's method
  - long ciphertext: more opportunity, more hint
  - short plaintext with a long key: not observe any repeating thing unfortunately
  - long repeated substring in a ciphertext: unlikely to be by chance
  - short repeated substring in a ciphertext: likely to be by accident
- Reference for Kasiski's method: [PDF](../other-resources/Week2b_MessageConfidentiality.pdf)

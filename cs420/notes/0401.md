- Loop -> we need to find the last value for phinodes..
- dominance frontier
  - insert phinode after dominance frontier.
  - 어디까지 dominant한지 선을 그려보자
- (p64) For loop -> Dominance frontier for C -> C
  - as first line of C is not dominated by the last line of C 
  - dominance frontier of E -> empty set as no edges.
  - Q) phinode inside phinode for C?
    - recursive하게 돌지만, 무한 루프는 아님.
- in p66 easier algorithm -> RPO
- impl single location first then to generalize multiple loc.

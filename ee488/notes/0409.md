- CMAC -> NIST standard
- MAC - like key-ed hash function

## hash based MAC

- secret prefix method
  - insecure if hash function is a Merkle-Damgard hash function
  - b/c of extension property

given: (x, tag_x) (where tag_x = H_k (x))
can we compute (x', tag_{x'}) without knowing key? -> YES.

- secret suffix method: much secure, attack needs 2^{n/2}
- envelope method
  - prevent both attacks
  - HMAC -> NIST standard

## mac vs signature

- mac: limitation -> generator and verifier need to share key in advance.
  - also, as key is shared: the other party can generate msg.
  - doesn't provide non-repudiation

## confidentiality and integrity

1. if random number sent with encryption -> how do we know the decrypted one is the real random number?
2. For ctr mode -> encryption alone is very dangerous (known-plaintext attack)

### adding redundancy

- e.g. add 100 bit of zero at the last in the plaintext
- or concate plaintext twice -> 반반 xor = 0 되면 ok
  - what if stream cipher? -> if we know 반반, then change 반반

### combine encryption & MAC

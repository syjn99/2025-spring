# CS330 - Operating Systems and Lab

> Instructor: Insik Shin

Learn an essence of Operating System by building my own OS (called [Pintos KAIST](https://casys-kaist.github.io/pintos-kaist/) ([GitHub](https://github.com/casys-kaist/pintos-kaist))). Used a well-known material: [Operating System Concepts by Silberschatz](https://os-book.com/).

## Features

- OS = **Abstraction**. Process and thread is an abstraction of a program execution. Virtual memory is an abstraction of a physical memory. File system is an abstraction of disk.
- The main project, **Pintos**, is one of the toughest projects for KAIST CS students.
- Also introduced other interesting systems: [Haystack](https://engineering.fb.com/2009/04/30/core-infra/needle-in-a-haystack-efficient-storage-of-billions-of-photos/) from Facebook, [FLUID](https://news.kaist.ac.kr/newsen/html/news/?mode=V&mng_no=4651), etc.

## What I learnt

- "**Abstraction** is a key of computer science": The professor has always emphasized this sentence through out the whole semester. All implementations for the abstraction have trade-offs, so every engineer should be aware of this when designing a new system.
- 150+ hours of programming in C: Mostly I didn't code with C, so building a project in pure C was challenging. Debugging a memory bug was very time-consuming, which means writing a program without worrying memory bugs is an INNOVATION. (e.g. Rust) However, finishing a Pintos project in my own helps me a lot to be confident about C programming.

## Page Replacement

- What if we don't have free frame? -> page replacement. (Swapping out)
  - reference string, compute page fault rate.

### FIFO

- Belady's anomaly: more frame but more page fault

### Optimal

- victim: not be accessed for the longest period of time.
- but we don't know the future string. just theoretic approach
- 전투력 측정기
- finding practical algorithm!

### LRU (Least Recently Used)

- let's use locality!
- victim: has not been used for the longest time.
- quite close to optimal.
  
#### Stack impl

- use dll, but we need to change 6 pointers
  - significant overhead
- this algorithm (Stack implementation) can never exhibit belady's anomaly

#### Counter/clock impl

- add column for page table. add clock
- issue
  - how can we get the time? -> syscall to get clock, lots of overhead.

#### Second-chance impl

- reference bit = 1: has been accessed in a very short past
  - so skip 1. (twice)
- if we encounter the zero -> victim.
- "we give second change to the page with reference bit 1"
- principle of locality

## Other issue in Page fault

- CPU must be idle during page fault handling.

## Thrashing

- not enough page = high page-fault rate = low cpu utilization = another process added to the system
- Thrashing: a process is spending much time in paging (more than executing).

## Working Set?

- hmm

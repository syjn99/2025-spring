## Prime

- prime definition
- p | ab => p | a or p | b -> proof by contradiction. (multiply a and b)
- **prime number theorem** -> although there are infinite number of prime, but it is proven the **dense** of prime number.
  - we have sufficient number of prime
- Fundamental theorem of arithmetic -> uniquely written 소인수분해
- pairwise relative prime
- modular arithmetic -> `m | a-b`
  - congruent(합동)
- Arithmetic inverse: `a^*`
  - suppose that gcd(a, n) = 1 -> a **has** an arithmetic inverse mod n
    - gcd(a,n) = 1 <=> ax+ny = 1 <=> ax - 1 = (-y)n <=> n | ax - 1 <=> ax \equiv 1 (mod n).
  - calculating inverse is very easy: use Euclidean algorithm in a logarithmic time.
  - ignore x^2 + 1 \equiv mod 8 -> just use proof by cases
  - YOU CANNOT DIVIDE a if gcd(a, n) != 1.
- number is divisble by 3, if sum of the all digits is divisble by 3
  - use `10 \equiv 1 mod 3`

## Caesar cipher

- `f(p) = (p + 3) mod 26`
  - right shift
  - p = letter (0 = A, ..., 25 = Z)
- Decryption: `f^{-1}(p) = (p - 3) mod 26`
  - left shift

## Cardinality

- number of members in the set.
- |Z| and |2Z| -> equal b/c we have the bijection function
- |Z| = |Q| << |R|

### Counting, Permutation, Combination

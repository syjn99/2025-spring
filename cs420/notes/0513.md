- coloring -> is like allocating registers ( ~ 31 regs)
- spill -> choose vertex w/ high degree (reduce register pressure)
- coalescing -> simple copy (with live range not 겹침) -> not going to increase register pressure
  - by assign to two physical register
  - resolve Question 3 from p.113
- chosse virtual register wisely

  - find a register that is contributing to a BIGGER coloring number
  - greedy algorithm: design a "heuristic" way.
- more algorithm
  - ssa-based allocation: well-known that ssa actually benefits register alloc, not dealing w/ this algorithm

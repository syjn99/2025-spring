[Lecture Note 4](../lecture-notes/Lec4.pdf)

## Product Cipher

- provide randomness with simple operation!
  - transposition, xor, linear transformation, arithmetic operation, mod mult, simple substitution...
- Feistel Cipher

## DES

- DES: 16 rounds
- DES history -> IBM suggests 128 bit, but finally standardized to 56 bit.. wtf
- IP - initial permutation: just mix input (no key)
- E - expansion table: 32 bit to 48 bit (b/c subkey = 48-bit)
  - handbook
- S - S-box is a table (secretly generated table)
  - turns 6-bit input to 4-bit output
  - split into 2-bit/4-bit, mapping with table -> 4*16 = 64 possibilities
  - nobody knows the s-box itself.

## AES

- Nov 2001 -> Rijindael (레인델)
- we want some mathematical basis!!
- byte level operation -> easy, but bit level operation -> hard for software

## Stream Cipher

- One-time Pad
- Wireless resource expensive -> LTE/5G
  - some bits are wasted
- PRNG(S_i, k) = S_i+1, while S_0 = IV -> can be used as an encryption function -> OFB (stream cipher mode)
  - we don't need decrypt function
  - CTR -> also can be used (not really)

## note

- third homework -> break the hash function
- hash function: not permutation, just random mapping
- random mapping statistics

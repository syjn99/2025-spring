# EE488 - Introduction to Cryptography Engineering (A+)

> Instructor: Yongdae Kim

Learn mathematical concepts (mostly number theory and algebra) to understand the major primitives in modern cryptography. All course materials are avaiable in [this link](https://syssec.kaist.ac.kr/~yongdaek/courses/ee488/).

## Features

- Learn the great concepts from well-known cryptographers in Symmetric key cryptography, Hash function, Public key cryptography, Digital signatures, Key establishment.
- Two programming projects: [Breaking a hash chain](https://github.com/syjn99/hash-chain) and implementing [Schnorr signature scheme](https://github.com/syjn99/schnorr-signature).

## What I learnt

- This course was really helpful for learning the important mathematical concepts to understand why all the cryptography schemes work. (e.g. Why is RSA secure?)
- The instructor wants the students to break geek schemes in the quizzes and exams. This was brain-teasing but fun and insightful.
- Unpopular opinion: I love Diffie-Hellman key exchange most, because of its simplicity and beauty.

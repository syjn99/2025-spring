[Lecture Note 8](../lecture-notes/Lec8.pdf)

- Chaum think of those three characteristic...!
- cash: untracability, one of the most important characteristc
  - also no duplication
- but for digital cash -> duplicate, fabricate with ease
  - we need **unforgability**
- attacker copy money and signature itself -> prevent **double spending**
  - check bank if this is not used.
- **Untracability**: how can we prevent bank from tracking the flow of money
- also put stamp: bank doesn't know serial number, but it is obviously signed.
- blind signature scheme!
  - based on RSA
  - and other schemes from Chaum: Multi/Group/Threshold...

## Identification - entity authentication

- combined with other processes.
  - once we have established key btw Alice and Bob -> Eve cannot do anything

- Lamport OTP: use hash chain
- Other OTP: every time generate random number, and hash with common password

## challenge-response authenitcation

- challenge -> fresh, but not random
- can all use ske, owf, pke, ds...
- compared to timestamp based on, random number based -> need one more round.

### Symmetric Key

- timestamp -> synchronization is very hard issue
  - every synchronization protocol has vulnerability.
- random -> must be non-repeating
  - but it can be a counter -> still ok. Freshness is more important

### One-way function

- use MAC - SKID3

FLUID: Enabling next-generation multi-device paradigm

- we have looked at fundamental, traditional OS.
- abtraction: create a new model that allows to ignore irrelevant details.
  - file: logical storage. ignoring the physical storage details
  - process: ignore the situation of resource
  - it is necessary that we have many understandings...

## Motivation

- we have many many smart devices
- also app is running on a single device
- so we don't use multiple devices simultaneously
- so without changing existing infra and app, can we implement new paradigm?
- one device with multiple ppl -> one device and one user (PC) -> multiple device and one user

- only same OS.. (b/c code is moved.)
  - cross platform manner?

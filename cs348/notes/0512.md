- use-after-free
  - free: not always erase the data. -> can be security problem
- to reliable sw de
  - basic principle: formatting, testing, clean code
  - secure coding
  - safe programming languages

- shoulf find bug BEFORE releasing SW.
- LOC increasing, Frequently change.
- we need "automatical" SW verification -> formally estimate: PL 분야의 발전된 방향이기도 함.

## Brief history

- no compiler at that time, system just read line by line, execute.
- but what if typo? -> lexical error. (grammatical error)
  - how to estimate whether this program is gramatically correct or not.
  - parsing == lexical analysis
- now well-formed, but sentence doesn't make sense. -> type error
  - type systems.
  - but some languages -> doesn't support static type checking.
    - e.g. JS, Python: dynamic type system (During execution)
- now well-formed, well-typed but ill-behaved
  - e.g. goto fail, buffer overflow
  - actively developed!
  - but no perfect solution - theoretically proven.

## Undecidability

- decidable problem: you can make algorithm problem!
  - e.g. sorting problem: quicksort, mergesort...
  - e.g.2 rsa cracking: enumerate all possibilities
  - e.g.3 compilation problem
  - it can be easy or hard.
- algorithm: automatic, exact, terminating
  - all conditions are satisfied. (in algorithm class...)
- undecidablilty: no such algorithm
- buffer overrun, integer overflow -> we cannot make algorithm.

### Proof of halting problem

- halting problem: classic example of undecidability
- does a machine eventually halt on specific input?
- proof by contradiction
- suppose there exists an algorithm: `H(T, i)`
- H is possible, so we can write another program: F
- `F(x) = if H(x, x) then loop() else halt()`
- `F(F)` -> `H(F, F)`
  - if true -> it terminates, then non-termination
  - if doesn't terminate -> then terminate.
  - `F(F)`의 종료 여부를 판단하는 게 바로 `H(F, F)`이기 때문에!
- 그래서 그 가정 (H가 존재한다)는 틀렸다.
- if halting problem is decidable -> every day earn novel prize -> e.g. fermat's last theorem

## Proof of Rice's theorem

- another proof by contradiction.
- **we know HP is undeciable.**
- suppose there exists an algorithm A: determine whether this program prints 1 and finish
- for any program P -> P' = P; print 1;
- A(P') -> true? -> P halts
- A(P') -> false? -> P does not halt.
- other example: division by zero analyzer
  - Write program: P' = P; x = 0; y/x;

## Toward computability

- disappointing... no algorithm ㅠㅠ
- engineer -> find a solution
- 하지만 알고리즘의 세가지 조건 중 하나를 포기한다면?
- no automatic: **assisted proving** -> formal verification??? (Q/A)
- no terminating: **model checking, testing**
  - using timeout. (run testing for 10 hrs)
- no exact: **static analysis**
  - approximate reasoning: print positive #

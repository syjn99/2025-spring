## Motivation

- Miscompilation in Android
- Bug in GVN...

## Intro

- what's memory model? two questions
  - 1) when is a memory operation undefined behavior?
  - 2) what's the value of load operation
- Flat memory model -> inhibits all optimization
- logical pointer vs physical pointer
  - behave very differently! so keep those in mind.

## Logical Pointer vs Physical Pointer

- provenance: 기원
- logcial pointer: 
  - we need to use base object
  - Use-Def chain -> p가 얼마나 가지고 있는지 파악
  - data-flow provenance
  - NoAlias detection -> super simple
- physical pointer
  - control-flow provenance
  - observed?
- round-trip like `p = (int*)(int)p` -> not equal!
  - p+n vs q ->  same address (valid) but only q is dereferenceable

## GVN is unsafe for...

- program can never quess the relative memory address
  - p+n == q -> undef.
  - so gvn for pointers -> not safte in some cases.
  - **only for these cases...**
    - q is nullptr
    - q is inttoptr
    - Both p and q are logical and are dereferenceable

## Pointer subtraction

- clang lowers to the integers -> but it leaks information
- comparision can move freely

## Alias Analysis

https://llvm.org/docs/AliasAnalysis.html

- from LLVM guide: determine whether or not two pointers ever can point to the same object in memory
- alias()
  - `alias(p, size_p, q, size_q)`
  - MayAlias -> IDK... (Conservative)
  - NoAlias
    - if two pointer is in the same object but we know the size so it is guaratneed that they don't overlap
    - in separate object
    - size 0
  - MustAlias
    - same starting point, fully/partially overlapped
  - PartialAlias
    - cannot determine starting point is same or not.
  - one obvious relationship -> 아쉽게도 그외 관계를 정립하진 않음.
  - AA must consider undefined behavior
- getModRefInfo() - ModRef analysis
  - how instructions affect memory instructions
  - Mod = modifies/writes, Ref = accesses/reads
  - 아하 함수 콜 할 때, 그 함수 안에서 어떤 일이 있을지 모르는거니까.. 일단 ModRef라고 하는 거구만 (슬라이드 31)

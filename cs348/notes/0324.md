## AS

- Pros and Cons of CTR-mode
- synchronize counters.
  - what if we miss the sequence? -> cbc, ctr have soem difference
- cbc -> less critical / ctr -> more critical
- cbc:
  - if C1 is missing, P1, P2 cannot be decrypted.
    - Still, P0, P3, P4,... can be decrypted.
  - but other are not broken
- ctr:
  - if one is missing, all will be broken

## MAC (Message Authentication Codes)

- Encrypt-then-authenticate: achieve secure communication

## Hash Function

- Cryptographic hash function vs hash function -> different

### 1. Preimage Resistance

> given `y`, computationally infeasible to find `x` s.t. `H(x) = y`

- one-way function (e.g. Factorization, Discrete Logarithm...)
- used in password hashing -> **precomputation attack**
- mitigation
  - slow hash func
  - salt
- `2^n` work is needed

### 2. Second-preimage Resistance

> given `x`, computationally infeasible to find `x'` s.t. `x != x'` and `H(x) = H(x')`

- e.g. Ubuntu release: attacker can easily manipulate binary file
- `2^n` work is needed

### 3. Collision Resistance

- (no assume of "given" sth)

> Computationally infeasible to find `x`, `x'` s.t. `x != x'` and `H(x) = H(x')`



- e.g. auction bidding
  - first, find two values that has same hash value
  - then, easily change my mind.

See [proof](./images/0324.HEIC)

- `2^{n/2}` work is needed (b/c birthday paradox)
- most important!

### Review

- collision resistance -> second-preimage resistance
- second-preimage resistance -> preimage resistance
- SHA-1 Broken
  - found two different PDF files
  - `2^63.4` operations needed

## Summary

- MAC vs. checksum
  - MAC provides secureness
  - checksum -> simply calculated, not designed for integrity
- MAC vs cryptographic hash function
  - MAC -> high level idea/scheme
  - cryptographic hash function -> just one implementation

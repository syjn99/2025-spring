## Real world problem

- producer - consumer problem
- readers - writer problem

  - let's deep dive into the situation how waiters can suffered by starvation

[Lecture Note 6](../lecture-notes/06-deadlock.pdf)

- dining-philosophers problem
  - correctness - we have to consider three things: mutual exclusion, progress, bounded waiting time
  - if all philosophers picked his left chopstick successfully, but they have to wait forever for right chopstick. -> DEADLOCK! (no one can proceed)
- vs. starvation -> thread waits **long** time.
  - deadlock -> no chance for finishing the waiting.
- ideas
  - what if we wait two chopsticks atomically?
  - system level monitoring? (if there's no left chopstick, avoid executing the waiting.)
  - **solution**: symmetric approach to chopstick pickup

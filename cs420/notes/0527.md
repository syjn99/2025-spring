## Pointer, Alias & ModRef Analyses

```c
int a[10];

for (int *p = a; p < a+ 10; ++p) {
    // ...
}
```

- idiomatic c code (iterating with pointer)
  - `a + 10` -> cannot dereference but itself safe.
  - similar to Nuno's talk
  - `pi` is replaced to `yi` by compiler
  - gcc's wrong compilation
- pointer may share same integer address (different lifetime pointers)
- memory model -> how pointer should behave.
- provenance -> origin of this pointer. compiler thinks it is important.
  - out of bounds = undefined behavior
- LLVM also built sophisticated alias tool.
  - MayAlias == I dont know. Give up!
  - NoAlias, MustAlias = strong answer
  - compiler wants to analyze this but we must have strong memory model.

## Finding your way around the LLVM dependence

- loop cannot be simplified parallized: how compiler optimize loop?
- distance example
  - or distance "vector"
  
```c
for (int i = 0; i < N - 2; i++) {
    int temp = A[i];
    A[i + 2] = temp;
}
```

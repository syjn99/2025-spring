[Lecture Note 4](../lecture-notes/Lecture%204%20Slides.pdf)

## Indistinguishability

- TRUE random generator -> `2^poly(n)`
- PRGs -> output is `2^n`. but adversary has only capability of `poly(n)`.

## Block Cipher

-> we don't want to keep very large key.
- instead of bitwise encryption, we want **block-wise** encryption.
- **PERMUTATION**

### Pseudo-Random Permutation (PRP)

- impossible to implement purely random permutation.
- all cases = `2^{n}!`
- three properties needed
  - functionality (one-to-one)
  - efficiency (exists "efficient" (= practical) algorithm)
  - security (indistinguishable)
    - if we have large `s`, much secure; indistinguishable

e.g.
- block length = 2 bits, key length = 2 bits
- possible permutation: `(2^2)!`

### Example: AES

- next hw: implement AES and crack
- World standard algorithm
- confusion, diffusion, key secrecy

#### Confusion

- we want attacker cannot guess key by looking at ciphertexts...
  - e.g. Caesar -> we can see the pattern
- hiding pattern -> obscure the relationship btw pt <-> ct

#### Diffusion

- spread out the msg. different sequence from pt.

#### Key Secrecy

- https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%EC%BC%80%EB%A5%B4%ED%81%AC%ED%98%B8%ED%94%84%EC%8A%A4%EC%9D%98_%EC%9B%90%EB%A6%AC
  - Ocaml impl: https://github.com/christiandaley/Various-Algorithms-in-OCaml/blob/master/AES.ml
- different key -> different ct
- algorithm secrecy should depend on only KEY.

#### Delve into AES

1. SubBytes = confusion
   - S-box: publicly open
2. ShiftRows = diffusion
   - i-th row -> i-byte shift
3. MixColumns = diffusion
    - matrix mul (fixed operand)
4. AddRoundKey = secrecy
   - Before this step, looks complex but not secure(as we don't use key)
   - **round** key = determined by key schedule algorithm

*Watch video: will be posted in course website.*

### Problem

- always one-to-one mapping (pt -> ct)
- -> **Probabilistic Encryption**


### Mode of Operation (운영 모드)

- single block operation to a sequence of blocks
- **ECB**, **CBC**, CFB, OFB, **CTR**

#### ECB (Electronic Code Block Mode)

- just one-by-one. simplest mode.
- easy to compute / but not probabilistic

#### CBC (Cipher Block Chaining Mode)

- use IV(initialization vector), and keep XORing...
- semantic security / slow...


### Padding

- zero padding -> interpreting is hard.. part of msg or part of padding?
- **PKCS#5(PKCS#7)**: padding with the number of bytes that are added

#### Padding Oracle Attack

- server only checks if padding is correct or not.
- but this service is not secure..!

[Lecture Note 13](../lecture-notes/Lecture%2013%20Information%20Security.pdf)

- static analyzer not running the program -> logically scan the program
- over approximate all possible behavior of a program (Give up exact reasoning)
  - sound, automatic but incomplete
- how we debug my code -> what static analyzer does.
- we don't give "complete" input, but only the range(approximate)

## Abstract (vs. Concrete)

- concrete: execution, dynamic / abstract: analysis, static
- we need abstraction to make things more clear
- abstract interpretation 1 -> like type checker
  - we have better, best interpretation
- to be sound -> your analysis should be conservative
- if your degree of abstraction is poor -> may have spurious alarm (false positive)
  
## Real World

- we'd like to detect many bugs
- if touching a red circle -> that's the error!
- abstraction -> 선을 보는 것이 아닌, 면으로 접근. (차원을 다르게)
  - all possible black line을 포함해야 함 (soundness를 위해)
- make a more precise abstraction

## Induction

- e.g. natural number.
  - zero is a natural number
  - if any n is natural number -> then n+1 is also a natural number
- e.g.2 List
  - nil is a list
  - if any l is List, then appending one element also list.
- if {0} is given -> phi({0}) = {1}
- if {10,11,12} is given -> phi({10,11,12}) = {0, 11,12,13}
- intersection -> always givethe smaller one.

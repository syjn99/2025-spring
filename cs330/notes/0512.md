## directory structure

- table: performance problem
  - OS design -> performance is very critical.
  - block: smallest unit of disk access (perspective of OS, sector -> performance of disk). 
    - 1 block = 4KB.
  - size of directory entry: as big as 128B
  - how many entry for single block -> 4KB / 128B = 32 entries.
  - e.g. 300 files in a single directroy -> we need around 10 blocks.
  - to access an ONE file, average we need to read 5 blocks.
  - how to reduce?: smaller directory table. (more entries in a single block)
- find a file name, and pointer.
  - then one entry = 64B -> reduce access into half.

## file-system implementation

- continguos allocation
  - issue: fragmentation. (~= memory allocation)
  - also a file want to use more blocks. -> e.g. mail -> only have three blocks next...
  - good lesson from memory management -> use paging.
- linked allocation
  - no random access
  - e.g. FAT (File-allocation table)
- for random access -> we use lookup table idea: indexed allocation.
  - e.g. one block = 4kb, one entry = 4B -> entry can be up to 1k.
  - then file size? -> 4mb (4kb * 1k)
  - so for storing 4GB file -> 1K index block should be needed, and allocated continuosly.
  - we may allocated make a hierachical way (like page table) for bigger file.
  - e.g. UNIX UFS -> FCB (= inode for UNIX terminology): mixed way of hierarchical table.
    - only 12 pointers for directly to data block.
  - size range through direct access? -> 48kb (= 4kb * 12 ptrs)
  - single indirect hieracrhacl access? -> for one index block = 1k. -> then 4MB storage. (4MB = 1k * 4kb)
  - double indirect = 4MB * 1k = 4GB
  - triple indirect = 4TB
- most file -> smaller than 48kb. (long-tail)

## file types.

## directory structure again

- directory itself a file. -> directory + FCB
  - use same mechanism.
- can be cyclic.
- name resolution: convert logical name into physical resource.
- e.g. resolve "/classes/cs330/lecture01.pdf"
  - first, we have to know directory table of "cs330".
  - parent directory table -> classes

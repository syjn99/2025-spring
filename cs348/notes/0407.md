Why relative prime? -> see gcd(a,b )  =d -> exists ax + by = d

gcd(e, phi(n)) = 1 -> ex + phi(n) y = 1 -> ex \equiv 1 \pmod{phi(n)}

- Question: what if we change e and d?
  - it doesn't matter in terms of correctness
  - typically we choose e first, and select d depending on e -> we choose small e for efficient computation
  - e is public, d is large number and must be prime.
  - also, if e is very large -> encryption takes very long time. good to have small e (m^e -> costly)
  - mostly, large server use decryption!!

- MAC vs Digital Signature
  - both guarantee integrity
  - MAC -> needs key exchange
    - when a SW distribution -> needs much much secret key
  - Digital signature -> just one pubkey -> then verify with.

- homomorphism (holy grail: 성배): computations on encrypted data.
  - without knowing plain password, Microsoft wants to check whether the password is robust or not.

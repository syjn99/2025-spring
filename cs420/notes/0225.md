## Foreword

- ISA is quite difficult to program directly, but human wants to expres more complex idea
- Just Intime Compiler (JIT): download and compile simulatenously
- graph-to-accelerator (AI/ML)
- FuriosaAI: hardware team * 2 = compiler team
    - even if it is hardware focused company
- App -> HW
    - goes to multiple layer of abstraction
    - library, **compiler**, serving system...

### relation between CS courses

- programming languages: CS220, CS320 -> What's idiomatic?
- systems: CS230, CS311 -> What's efficient
  - So, how to **tranlsate** btw pl and system?: **CS420**
  - Also how do we verify whether compiler is correct or not?: Will be tested in exams.

### Course

- midterm might be canceled
- HW: KECC (KAIST Educational C Compiler)
- If performs comparably with gcc -O1.
- If you finish assembly generation (HW7) -> usually A+
- LLM: may use.

## Compiler organization

source code -> Compiler -> machine code

divide compiler into multiple phases as compiling is somewhat huge.
- Parser: from string to **mathematical** representation, usually **tree**
    - abstract syntax tree (AST)
    ```rust
    fn main() {
        let x = 42;
        println!("{}", x);
    }
    ```

    ```plaintext
    function
    - name: main
    - params: []

    two children here:

    1. assignment
    - variable: x
    - value: 42

    1. function call
    - println!
    - args: "{}", x
    ```
    - Type Checker
- IRGen: Intermediate representation
  - IR language: optimization-friendly
- Optimization: directly serving the performance
  - Fill the gap btw idiomatic and efficiency
  - improve code size, time, space, energy...
  - e.g. register promotion: memory access  -> register access
  - e.g. constant propagation and loop unrolling for named constants
  - Many many theories
- Asmgen: 2d data structure
  - IR to machine code
  - we need to fit final # of register(e.g. x86, RISC-V...)
  - Dependent on architecture
- Printer: AST to machine code(string)
  - Dependent on architecture

QnA
- Mostly, compiler engineer prioritize runtime.
- JIT: compile time is part of runtime

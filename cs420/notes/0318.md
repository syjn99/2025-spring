## Static Single Assignment (SSA)

- only register is defined once.
  - (cf) MemorySSA(advanced concept, skipped)

`t = a ? b :c`
- ternary computation doesn't have to compute `b` and `c` at the same time

->

```
t = alloc // local allocation to store the value, only for IR generation. Optimization will remove most of the allocation.

%cond = (compute a)
j %cond btrue bfalse

btrue:
%b = (compute b)
store t %b
j bcont

bfalse:
%c = (compute c)
store t %c
j bcont

bcont:
<!-- %t = ? // a ? b : c -> t를 어떻게 구할 수 있을까? -->
%t = load t

```

- this memory allocation **will** be optimized as a phinode.

- Question: is `%t = %a ? %b : %c` is valid?
  - (Suppose we have ternary operator in IR)
- Answer: INVALID.
  - because `%b` or `%c` might not be defined. (`%a` should be defined at the time.) 

### (cf) Domination

- "D -> (dom) U"
  - all paths to U should have visited D
- must be held in well-formed IR

### Example: Loop

- to satisfy SSA, use phinode.
- in IRgen -> not generate any phinodes

#### QnA
- loop unrolling vs phinode
  - loop unrolling -> can reduce branch, but code size will be long.
  - tradeoff.
  - but modern branch trangister is good. -> switch is negligible

- loop unrolling ->  see "Software pipelining: An effective scheduling technique for VLIW machines" [PDF](../resources/960116.54022.pdf)
  - optimize by reordering, pipelining...
  - this paper -> instr schedule can be hugely beneficial

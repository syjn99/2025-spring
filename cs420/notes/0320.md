## Control Flow Graph (CFG) Simplification

- not very associated with SSA
- constprop/reach/merge/empty

### QnA

- we have four ideas, does the sequence matter?
  - A. I don't have proof but I strongly believe order doesn't matter
- does optimization keep repeating until it is finally optimized?
  - A. `-O1` flag already implemented
  - See `Repeat` Struct

## Register Promotion (Later revisited)

## Global Value Numbering (GVN)

- most important opt using SSA -> SSA will greatly simplifiy the optimization.
  - EXPLOIT SSA
- remove redundant computation: check only **syntactically equivalence**
- multiple paths to impl this. WHY?
  - tradeoff. (if there is no tradeoff, there must be one best solution)
  - "how much redundancy is removed" vs. "faster compile time"
  - GVN is more closer to first one. (sacrifice compile time)
  - this semester we care how much we can optimize the IR.
- but carefully investigate **domination relation** of the blocks.
  - replaces A with B of the same number, only if B dominates A.
  - e.g. b0 -> b2 -> b3: available path. so b3 is not dominated by b1.

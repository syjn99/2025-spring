## Group

- (Z, +) -> Abelian Group
- multiplication, divide -> not group (no inverse)
- (Z_n, mod) -> Group
- 2 * 2 Matrix
  - + -> Group
  - Mul -> Not a group b/c some matrix doesn't have inverse
- Cyclic group
  - e.g. (Z_n, +_mod): cyclic group. generator: any number relatively prime to n (adding one again and again)
  - e.g.2 (Z_p^*, *_mod): cyclic group.

## Subgroup

- $: There exists.
- Subgroup -> 반드시 identity와 각자의 inverse를 포함

## Diffie-Hellman

- Given g^n1 mod p and g^n2 mod p, it is infeasible to find g^{n1 * n2} mod p.
- break DLP -> break diffie-hellman: Of course yes.
- Diffie hellman -> DLP?: never proven
- Authentication: MITM
  - Eve tells different g^n1'.
  - so we need authentication.
- better implementation
  - 이거 다시 찾아보기!!! (patent?)
  - g's order = 160
  - so 2048 multiplication required => 320 multiplication required! (7 times speed up)
    - w/o losing any security
- even in case elliptic curve -> consider group built on eliptic group
  - can reduce message size while group size is still same.

# 0227

- any other structure different from traditional C compiler
  - e.g. JS
  - compile w/o optimization
  - some code block is hot!
  - 연역적인 방법
- vscode: type code, automatically compile simulataneously
  - providing "Some" language processing == **language server**
- **Read llvm docs, manual quite often**

## Intermediate Representation (IR)

> Skipping **Parser** part. (b/c [1] parser already provided in KECC, [2] beyond the topic for single semester course)

- design decisions, inspired by LLVM(Low Level Virtual Machine) IR
  - LLVM: by Chris Lattner. research about JIT for C, C++ compiler
  - but JIT feature was dropped.
- **Control-flow graph**: all branch is like **block**. -> serving opti for statement-based language. (e.g. loop)
  - consist of intruction blocks(nodes) + Jump/Conditional jump(edges)
  - also exceptions can be represended as graph model. much easier to impl
  - similar to Asm
  - refer to `call` in llvm for function call
- **Register machine**: compute **only** on register, not on memory.
  - memory is accessed via load/store instruction
  - e.g. we can only add value on register
  - similar to actual HW architecture
  - register guarantess non-interferences: specific location in memory can be an **alias**. many function can point to single address. That's problem!!
  - So implementing correctly is much easier.
  - if we leak pointer to variable(to function/global variable), then we **cannot** ensure that the variable is immutable.
  - However, register doesn't take address
  - We assume that we have **infinite number of register** in IR (for ease)
    - we do register allocation in Asmgen
- **No ambiguous variable name**: human understands scope, but same variable name can be ambiguous to compiler.
  - should maintain a map data structure
  - [cf] javascript dynamic scoping -> not **modular**: function can change other vars meaning

```js
fn foo() {
    var x = 42;
    bar();
}

fn goo() {
    var x = 666;
    bar();
}

fn bar() {
    println!("{}", x); // static scoping: compile error / dynamic scoping: may work
}

fn main() {
    foo(); // 42
    goo(); // 666
}
```

- **Explicitly annotated types**: `auto` keyword. Compiler, please infer the type.
  - implicit to explicit
  - disambiguate all things related to type.
- **Static single assignment (SSA)**: single most important/beautiful concept in programming language
  - invariant: **A register is defined at most once in code**
  - If not, we don't have to see if specific register has changed, this is really time consuming.

```rust
loop {
    let mut %x = 42; // x is only defined once by SSA
    // %x += 1;
    // %x = 666;

    ...

    println!("{}", %x); // should remain same,
                        // println!("{}", 42);
}

// no ref to %x outside the loop.
```

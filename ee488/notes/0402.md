## Hash properties

- collision resistance -> second-preimage resistance
- collision resistance x-> preimage resistance(one-way)
  - consider some other function that concates one bit.

post quantum
-> symmetric-key cryptography, hash function - just increase size twice
-> but for public-key cryptography -> we are all worried about shor's algorithm!

- hash is not random: but we can "regard" it as a random.

## Merkle-Damgard Scheme

- strengthen -> pad the length of message M.

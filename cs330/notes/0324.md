[Lecture Note 5](../lecture-notes/05-synchronization.pdf)

- if web server creates too many threads(unbounded threads) -> we can use bounded **pool** of threads
  - slave - master thread architecture
  - master: manage receiving connecton, put the request into queue
  - slaves: do work for dequeued.
- banking server -> should do work "accurately"
  - e.g. Deposit -> GetAccount / Add balance / StoreAccount
  - single thread -> too slow, performance issue
  - multi thread -> one thread per request
- but, for multi-thread architectuere, shared state can get corrupted -> concurrency problem
  - as `acct->balance += amount;` is compiled to three instructions

```
load r1, acct->balance
add r1, amount
store r1, acct->balance
```

## Race Condition

- unpredictable behavior, difficult to debug.
- Critical Section: a piece of code that accesses a shared resource.
- Mutual Exclusion: ensuring that only one thread executes critical section -> one thread *excludes* the others whole doing its task.
- Synchronization: coordinating of concurrent processes or threads.

- We need **waiting** for all synchronization.

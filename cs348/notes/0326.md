[Lecture Note 6](../lecture-notes/Lecture%206%20Information%20Security.pdf)

- availability -> not single bulletproof solution.
  - identify and remove
  - give privilege
  - overprovision: buy a big server
  - distinguish and filter

## Example: SYN Flooding

- three-way handshake on TCP/IP networks
  - -> SYN (can you hear me?)
  - <- SYN-ACK (yes, can you hear me too?)
  - -> ACK (I can hear you)
  - e.g. Zoom Meeting lmao
- SYN Flooding -> send tons of SYN packets
  - server **stores** the info -> base reason for resource exhausting


### SYN Cookie

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SYN_cookies

- space <-> time has always tradeoff.
  - e.g. Dynamic programming
- Let's RECOMPUTE. (as space is the problem)
- send **ISN** (Initial Sequence Number) with SYN-ACK
  - each connection has unique ISN
  - ISN computation - very cheap
- stateless communication

## Puzzle-based DDoS Defense

-> e.g. CAPTCHA

### 1. secure-hash-based proof of work

- 비트코인이랑 똑같네
- can easily increase difficulty
- stateful operation -> give different puzzles per user.
- -> how can we make this stateless?

### 2. Generate puzzles with a secret key

- puzzle problem can be recomputed by existing known information + my secret key.
- T (MAC) is fixed -> change secret keys...

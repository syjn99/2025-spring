## Inductive Definition of Set

```OCaml
type nat = Zero | Succ of nat
```

phi^0 = {}
phi^1 = {0}
phi^2 = {0, 1}
phi^3 = {0, 1, 2}
...
-> union of all the result = Natural number

- closure = "all reachable/possible/provable/derivable/..."
- transitive closure of a graph = "all reachable" nodes from each node
- in static analysis - "all possible" effects of the operations
  - fixed point: phi(X) = X인 X!
  - e.g. solving x = sin x
  
## Example

### Pointer Analysis

- during the execution, what kind of pointer information is computed.
- e.g. `x = &a`: x -> a. (x points to a)

```c
x = &a;
y = &x;
while (*) {
    *y = &b;
}
*x = *y;
```
- immediately: x -> a, y -> x
- loop body: x -> b
- last line: x can be {a, b} -> a -> a, a -> b, b -> a, b -> b
- 총 7개 (points-to facts)

- Base case for pointer analysis (= initial facts): if you observe `x := &y` then `x -> y`
- Inductive cases (= deriving new facts)
  - copy information: if `x := y` and `y -> z` then `x -> z`
  - indirect assignment: `*x := y`, `x -> w`, `y -> z`, then `w -> z`
  - dereference rule: `x := *y`, `y -> z`, `z -> w`, then `x -> w`
  - `*x := *y`, `x -> w`, `y -> z`, `z -> v`, then `w -> v`

### Taint Analysis (오염 분석)

- is there any path from src to sink without sanitizing
- compute def-use facts
  - 하나씩 마킹하기

`l: x := E`
- x is defined at line `l`.
- => `Def(l, x)`

`l: E = y`
- y is used at line `l`.
- => `Use(l, y)`

`l: x = src()`
- => `Src(l)`

`l: x = san(y)`
- => `San(l)`

... and so on


- static analyzer always terminate. -> why?
  - ~= compiler always terminate.
  - # of all possible predicate = always finite
  - finite line number * finite number of variable -> finite
  - rule always generate new fact
- guideline to design static analyzer
  - rigorous way -> see you CS524
  - exist of prove.
  - 일단 간단하게, 유한한 곳에서 계속 monotone하게 추가하니까 종료된다!

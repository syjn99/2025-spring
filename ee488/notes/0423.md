[Lecture Note 6](../lecture-notes/Lec6.pdf)

- two import problem: factorization & DLP(Discrete logarithm problem)
  - very very important

## Integer Factorization Problem

- Trial Division
  - (2, 3, 5, ...)
  - Eratosthenes Sieve: test up to sqrt(n)
  - we do not deal with advanced factorization algorithm
  - 1024-bit -> best: 2^80

## RSA

- based on Factorization Problem
  - of course you know p, q from n.
- m can never be greater than n: as it is not used for message encryption. delivering key
- if m, n is not coprime -> lucky! factorizaiton -> but negligible
- recommended to same size p and q (b/c elliptic curve factor)
- and also p - q should be large enough

### Security

- lemma: a^2 \equiv 1 mod n
  - then a -> 1, -1, a, -a
  - proof: CRT
  - a^2 \equiv 1 mod p and a^2 \equiv 1 mod q
  - -> a \equiv +- 1 mod p and a \equiv +- 1 mod q
  - so four solution: (1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1)
  - (1, 1) => 1, (-1, -1) => -1
  - see example.
- computing d from (n, e) =(computationally)= factoring n
- if e = 3 (small encryption exponent) -> of course insecure.
  - never encrypt message as message, add some randomness
- homomorphic property in multiplication
  - w/o knowing plaintext, we can find ciphertext of (m1 * m2)
  - cf) homomorphic encryption: looks ideal but too slow
  - and also market share, nobody using
    - cloud vendor -> use SGX(by Intel), Trustzone(by ARM)
    - device vendor -> AMD, Apple, Samsung...

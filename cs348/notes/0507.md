## Attacks

### Stack-based buffer overwrite

- return address -> very important
  - control-flow hijacking
  - put arbitrary code (e.g. `rm -rf`) and change return address to what I put the code in.

### Heap-based buffer overwrite

- if important data stored
  - access control / function pointers
- always use buffer checking APIs. not using `strcpy` but `strncpy`

Then how to protect return address
- canary!

## Defense

### Canary

- insert a value before local address. (Randomly chosen by system)
- `gcc -fstack-protector` 

### Non-executable memory

- data execution prevention -> doens't allow execute the code on certain part of memory (e.g. stack)
- heap, stack -> doesn't give permission for execution.
- backward compatability -> but modern os will always be compatible
- JIT -> during the execution, make binary code.

## Other attacks

- injection is prevented!

### Libc

https://rninche01.tistory.com/entry/RTLReturn-To-Libc

- libc: important code e.g. system calls.
- `system()`: take arbitrary string into shell instruction
- bypass injection protection mechanism -> doesn't inject new code. pass argument!

### ASLR

- modern OS all has. randomly change the base address.

## Last attack

### Return-oriented programming

- without libc, can we just reuse "user's code"?
- collect sequence of existing code = gadgets
  - end with jump instruction: `ret`, `jmp`
- stack smashed -> buffer overflow, so buffer overwrite

- control-flow integrity: compile 단계에서 estimate되어야 함.
  - performance overhead. How many return statement!!!
  - `-cfi` : modern compiler
- deadcode can be also security problem -> please debloat!
- (Q) more functions -> is this threat?
  - it depends: good refactoring -> make code size smaller

## Other attack (not buffer overwrite)

- unsafe type casting, integer overflow

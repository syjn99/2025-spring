## More math!

- typo 5x = 1 (mod 14) -> x = 3 (mod 14)
- multiplicative inverse ~= arithmetic inverse of modulo
- c.f.
  - (G, o) (o <- operation)
  - 1. G is closed
  - 2. G has identity
  - 3. G has an inverse
  - -> then this is GROUP
- chinese remainder theorem (CRT)
  - construct common solution
- corollary

if r - s \equiv \phi (n) -> r - s = k \cdot \phi (n)
then a^{r - s} \equiv a^{k \cdot \phi (n)} \equiv (a^{\phi (n)})^{k} \equiv 1 \pmod n
-> important building block for RSA.
- finding m that is not relatively prime to n -> break RSA.

- generator: by multiplying repeatedly, generate the whole set
  - ord_n (a) == \phi (n)
  - not all group has the generator.
- e.g. genertor of Z_17 *
- if 2 is not generator
- just one operation -> 1, 4, 8, 16, 15, 13, 9 removed!
- 15 -> -2 mod 17 
- we have to use modular exponentiation **efficiently**
  - square-and-multiply: O(logN)!

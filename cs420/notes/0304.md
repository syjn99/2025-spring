## IR

```ir
fun i32 @main () {
init:
  bid: b0 # first block
  allocations: 
    %l0:[5 x i32]:a # canonical name / type / programmer-friendly name
    %l1:i32:len
    %l2:i32:i

block b0:
  # l1 must be a pointer (b/c it is locally assigned)
  # `unit` -> return void, none, etc...
  # i0 == instruction 0.
  %b0:i0:unit = store 5:i32 %l1:i32* 
  j b1()
}

block b1:
  %b1:i0:unit = store 0:i32 %l2:i32*
  j b2()

block b2:
  # each instruction has some values
  # u1 -> 1-bit value, unsigned == boolean
  %b2:i0:i32 = load %l2:i32*
  %b2:i1:i32 = load %l1:i32*
  %b2:i2:u1 = cmp lt %b2:i0:i32 %b2:i1:i32
  # branch from the comparison
  br %b2:i2:u1, b3(), b5()

- huge similarity to LLVM.
  - few simplification b/c consistency

  - parser
  - peg: parser generator
- https://github.com/kaist-cp/kecc-public/blob/main/src/ir/mod.rs
  - top level in-memory data structure
    ```rust
    #[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq)]
    pub struct TranslationUnit {
        pub decls: BTreeMap<String, Declaration>,
        pub structs: HashMap<String, Option<Dtype>>,
    }
    ```
- store allocation for function
    ```rust
    #[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq, Eq)]
    pub struct FunctionDefinition {
        /// Memory allocations for local variables.  The allocation is performed at the beginning of a
        /// function invocation.
        pub allocations: Vec<Named<Dtype>>,

        /// Basic blocks.
        pub blocks: BTreeMap<BlockId, Block>,

        /// The initial block id.
        pub bid_init: BlockId,
    }
    ```
    ```rust
    #[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq, Eq)]
    pub struct Block {
        pub phinodes: Vec<Named<Dtype>>, // We will discuss later
        pub instructions: Vec<Named<Instruction>>,
        pub exit: BlockExit, // the last instruction could be exit/branch the block
    }

- visualize.rs -> visualizer for IR in a graph form
- HW4 will use provided IR tools. (`kecc-public/src/ir`)
- llvm ir gen script will be provided.
  - result should be same if you wrote IR gen. 
  - model solution: https://gist.github.com/cmpark0126/459514e8e73cac0c76284b8ec47334a7
- https://godbolt.org/ will help your HW: see what is generated through compiler.
  - `-S -emit-llvm` option: llvm IR generation
  - `-O1` some optimzation
- actually `gcc` doesn't provide useful documentation

## IRGen

- related to HW2
- IRGen: C AST -> IR AST
- hierarchically translating to units (including variable decl and function def)
- c.f. How to read C types
- https://github.com/vickenty/lang-c -> `TranslationUnit`
  - `ExternalDeclaration` -> `Declaration` & `FunctionDefinition` (not using `StaticAssert`)
- Goal: producing efficient IR ❌, producing **correct** IR 🅾️

Q&A
- merging all source code then compile vs. merge later with object file?
- MLTon: optimizing by compiling whole-program -> spot more opti opportunity.
  - function inlining - one of the best optimization in C
- Linking and Compiling should be commute (교환 가능)
  - one of the first paper of prof: formal verification
  - How can we verify that the result is same?
    - investigate register state? -> too strong
    - **observable behavior** must be same
      - **if syscall sequence is same**

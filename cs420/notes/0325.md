- reverse post-order (RPO): important in this course
  - Post-order: not deterministic
- benefit of RPO
  - easy to compute
  - related to **domination**
    - never reverse-domination-relationship in RPO
    - consistency with domintation relation
- (cf) why don't we use pre-order?
  - in class, open ending... b/c pre-order also has consistency with domination relation 
  - preorder에선 leader table 계산을 적게, RPO에선 앞에 있는 최대한의 leader table들을 업데이트하고 넘어가기 때문에 -> 좀 더 optimization의 기회가 있나?
- If [LT@Bfinal(Ⓝ) exists for all predecessor B of %i’s block],
then creates a new phinode, say %p=ϕ({LT@Bfinal(Ⓝ) | B ∈ pred(%i)});
let LT@pc(Ⓝ) = %p; and replaces %i with %p. -> **See Example 3**
- leader table: **candidates** to replace the value later on.
- one gvn application -> optimize **as possible as it can**.
  - but when other optimization comes in -> gvn can do some task after each optimization.

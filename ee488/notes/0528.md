## 4G LTE Cellular Network Overview

- User Equipment (USIM or ESIM) -> eNodeB(4G, for 5G: gNodeB)
- gateway -> device that connect two different network
- S-GW looking at cell tower, P-GW looking at internet
- MME -> 
- HSS -> hacked at SKT (in charge of security)
  - IMSI, key, phone number
  - IMSI: serial number associated with your sim card ~= personal, permanent, IDentity information
  - key: used to derivate the rest of process
- IMS: server for VoLTE
  - VoIP -> using internet for messaging (iMessage, messanger call...)
  - skt **moved HSS under IMS** -> for fast call setup time
- 5G SA -> change whole core network -> only implemented by KT
  - 5g -> only improve air time (no latency improved in internet connection)
  - telco industry need money lol

## Key Hierarchy

- only using sym key.
  - HSS has all the keys for individual -> without changing the key -> no safe way!!!
  - ck -> encryption key, ik = integrity key
  - NAS: protocol between phone and MME
- IMSI -> not encrypted
  - AUTN: authentication vector
  - SQN: sequence number between UE and HSS
  - K_{ASME} -> can be computed by SQN, AK, CK, IK
    - session key are derived based on K_{ASME}
- SKT Fraud detection system -> cannot be two phone. (in normal situation) -> tried to disconnect the later one
- USIM protection service -> unique to Korea only.
  - IMEI -> identity bound to your phone. store relation btw IMSI and IMEI
  - BIND IMEI and IMSI -> I'm not going to change my phone.
    - using 미디어텍 IMEI editor -> can duplicate IMEI!
  - 한국만 이렇게 전통적으로 binding하고 있기 때문에 유심 보호 서비스가 가능함.
- 어떤 공격이 더 가능할까? 생각해보기

- Uplus -> KPI가 에러 메시지를 줄이는 것.. false location update -> 그냥 무시 ㅋㅋ

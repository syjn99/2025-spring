- Kerberos -> expensive
  - also spof, spoa
- how can we revoke for ID based encryption?
  - hard.
- IBE -> solves government, military problems (Kerberos requires many round)
  - however pkg knows all the things -> can decrypt.
  - revokation problem -> 이거 땜에 망함
  - 그렇다고 매일 발행하기엔 그냥 kerberos를 쓰면 되지 않나
- non-repudiation: 일단 무시
- trust issue -> CA will be only issuing certifcate.
  - CA compromised -> future compromised
  - PKG / AS (Kerberos) -> all past keys compromised

## Threshold crypto

- many application -> distribute key to N people, if t people agree -> you can open
- how to split the key
  - **Shamir's threshold** vs. Braset?'s threshold -> scheme very similar
- using 라그랑주 interpolation

---

## Cellular security

- cellular specification -> contain many vulnerability
  - reveal exploitation
- can we test implementation vulnerability

- data -> packet switch, voice -> ... switch
- from LTE -> ip layer
  - until 3G -> very hard to research
  - high learning curve
- fake base station attack: 
  - base station: strong signal
- Fake UE
  - spec exists, open sourced
- sniffer -> collect unencrypted traffic
- standard based development 
  - written by human using natural language
  - contradictory sentences... cannot deal with all possible exception
  - -> specification(design) vulnerability
  - also we cannot change standard...

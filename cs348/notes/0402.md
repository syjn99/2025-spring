## SKE

- we have to share
- and also so many keys to maintain

## PKE

- recap -> modular operation

## Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange

- public value: p(large prime), g(generator), g^a mod p, g^b mod p.
- based on **discrete logarithem problem**
  - quantum computer can break with shor's algorithm 

## RSA

- using factorization
- wow!

- Pro: no secure key distribution is needed.
  - also, multiple senders.
- Con: much much slower
  - we use PKE to share SKE, and encryption is using with SKE.

also important problem -> man in the middle attack
also, deterministic encryption

## Digital Signature

- reverse way to communicate: server to alice.

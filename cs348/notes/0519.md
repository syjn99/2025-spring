[Lecture Note 12](../lecture-notes/Lecture%2012%20Slides.pdf)

two possible category
- **dynamic approach**: run program N times and detect bug -> today lecture!
- static approach

## Testing

- unsound yet complete.

## Fuzzing

- adding random noise on a input!
- found many crash bug in UNIX utilities
- more required fuzzer will have "monitor"
  - observe all the execution
  - whether source code available or not
- blackbox vs whitebox
  - blackbox: easy to implement but hard to explore deep part (monkey cannot generate valid c code)
  - whitebox: generate by observing the code.
  - constraint solving ~= equation solving
- problem: input will be filtered at the early stage.
- collect all valid input
  - "seed corpus"
  - slightly mutate a "portion" of the valid input
  - mutator (숙제)
    - random bit flip
    - simple arithmetic mutation
    - block-based
  - problem: limited by seed inputs
    - if there is hidden semantic -> rejected... (even though syntactically correct)
    - e.g. 주민등록번호 https://blog.naver.com/mumasa/222102707153
    - solution: encode the rules.
- generation based
  - automatically infer (using llm, etc.)
- Some questions
  - is this fuzzer in local minimum? (revisit redundant paths...)
  - how can we acheive gradual/continuous/fine-grained feedback
  - also achieving divergence
    - very small amount of specie, each of them slightly mutate, two mutant generate new generation.. and so on.
    - seed pool keep more divergent.
    - also we need selection (목이 긴 기린이 살아남음) -> genetic algorithm 유전 알고리즘 (is this input "interesting"?)
- coverage-guided fuzzing
  - fitness function: coverage.
- more question: in general, how to test functionality bug (not crash bug) -> you need specification (oracle)
- other: more than coverage, what is good for fitness function?

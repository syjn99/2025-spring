## XSS

- bypass SOP -> make two contents have the same origin
- two well-known ideas
  - reflected XSS: in the example, url was too long -> query contains malicious script (e.g. `alert("XSS")`)
  - stored XSS

### Reflected XSS

- reflection my string: "Kihong"
- origin is still `victim.com`

### Stored XSS

- web board -> hacker uploads question with malicious script
- e.g. KLMS

### Prevent

- always! sanitize input
- CSP: more fine grained control

## CSRF (Cross-site Request Forgery)

- unwanted action on already authenticated.
- ~= confused deputy problem
- Referrer checking: where is the source?
- hidden csrf-token (secret validation token)

주로 CSRF를 하기 위해서 사용되기 때문에 종종 CSRF와 혼동되는 경우가 있으나, XSS는 자바스크립트를 실행시키는 것이고, CSRF는 특정한 행동을 시키는 것이므로 다르다.

[Lecture Note 10](../lecture-notes/Lecture%2010%20Information%20Security.pdf)

- going more deeper (access control -> web security -> and sw vulnerability)
- CWE -> common cases
- CVE -> instances
- safety bugs and functionality bugs

e.g. heartbleed bug (buffer overread)
e.g.2 goto fail
  - formatter is important...

why memory safety security problem?

## Vernam Cipher

- confidentiality
  - unbreakable, even unlimited computing power and time
  - information-theoretically secure
- limitation
  - key sharing problem
  - not truly random
  - key length >= msg length

## Practical encryption

### Compromising for practicallity

- make our definition more practical. How much can we compromise?
- attacker capability -> `2^80`, information leak probability -> `2^-60`
- introduce **(t-epsilon)-distinguishable**
  - large t, small epsilon is great.
  - adjusting parameter

#### Asymptotic Formalization

- (결국에 어찌될지 분석)
- difficulty of problem. AT THE END, how the problem behaves
- like Algorithm course.
- we use typically length of key as `n`
- **Asymptotically Secure**: Probabilistic **polynomial**-time (PPT) -> `n^k`
  - probabilistic -> attacker can randomly guess
  - polynomial -> attacker can spend polynomial amount of time. polynomial ~= realistic
  - negligible -> denote epsilon with `n`.
  - `(t - e) <=> (poly(n) - (poly(n))^-1)`
- semantic security -> attacker cannot compute any function of the plaintext from the ciphertext <=> computationally indistinguishable
  - See high level story at pg 18.

### Pseudo-random generators (PRGs)

- function(seed) -> "random-looking" string
  - if my random number "looks like" purely random in polynomial time, it is pseudo-random.

### Block Cipher

- similar concept with Vigenere.
  - (vs. stream cipher) - Vernam cipher
- idea: permutation!
  - dependent on key, you will have different mapping.
  - see pg 23 -> green key and red key. different function.
- AES ->  we use in WiFi connection -> WPA2 Enterprise use AES scheme.

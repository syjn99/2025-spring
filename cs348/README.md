# CS348 - Introduction to Information Security (A+)

> Instructor: Kihong Heo

Learn how to secure 1) data and 2) program. Cryptography is a key component for the former, and program analysis for the latter. Every materials and discussions are [public](https://github.com/prosyslab-classroom/cs348-information-security).

## Features

- Cryptography: Encryption schemes, hash function, MACs (Message Authentication Codes), Public key cryptography, Access Control.
- Program Analysis: Common software bugs(e.g. buffer overread/overwritten), Fuzzer, Static Analysis.
- Eight OCaml projects including Encryption, Hash, Fuzzer, Static Analyzer, etc.
- My essay about the cybersecurity is on [Hall of Fame](https://github.com/prosyslab-classroom/cs348-information-security/blob/main/essay/2025-Youngjun_Song.pdf)! (The essay is written in Korean.)

## What I learnt

- **Amazing, well-structured class**: In my own opinion, this course is the best course in KAIST CS in terms of structure. With a series of fascinating lectures from the instructor, students can learn what they "heard" at the lectures by building their own implementations. I'm sure that no other class provides the learning experience like this course, including the courses from other universities.
- Confidence of **learning** a programming security topics: As I delved into very basic building blocks of information security, I think I'm now able to learn any related concepts with ease.
- PL is fun: Taking with [CS320](../cs320/), I realized I enjoy PL in the computer science most.
- OCaml is great: It was my first experience in writing code with OCaml, and it was super cool. One of my favorite concept in functional programming is pipelining, and it seems it's idiomatic for OCaml codes. From contructing very basic blocks (e.g. a very small function) to passing data through out those functions, I definitely enjoyed the whole experience.

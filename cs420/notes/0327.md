## Definition of domination

https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~nanaeem/cs744/slides/dom.pdf

-> refer this for algorithms

- **y dominates x**: all the paths visit y beforehand
- theorem: if y and z both dominate x -> then y ->dom z or z ->dom y.
- always form a **tree** -> cross section edge is not allowed
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_order
  - domination relation forms a total order.

- quiz answer: domination!!!!!!

## Deadcode elimination

- `store` has a side effect: changes the state of memory
- function can be annotated with attribute
  - e.g. LLVM reference
```
readnone
This attribute indicates that the function does not dereference that pointer argument, even though it may read or write the memory that the pointer points to if accessed through other pointers.

If a function reads from or writes to a readnone pointer argument, the behavior is undefined.

readonly
This attribute indicates that the function does not write through this pointer argument, even though it may write to the memory that the pointer points to.

If a function writes to a readonly pointer argument, the behavior is undefined.
```
  - but in KECC, we don't have attribute.

## Other opt

- peephole
  - add associativity. 
    - but div, min, floating point operation -> not associativity.
    - llvm fastmath flag -> make floating point operation to be associatible.

## ElGamal

Permat's theorem
```
-> a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{p}
-> a^{-x} \equiv a^{p-1-x} \pmod{p}
```

- randomized encryption.
- we need good random number generator for k.
  - we need enough random sources (entrophy) -> but embedded system not enough

how about just adding (not multiplying)?
- c = m + y^{k} \pmod{p}
- m = c - r^{x} \pmod{p}

### Comparison (vs. RSA)

RSA
  - c = m^e mod n 
  - m = c^d mod n

- encryption: e can be chosen with small #. -> less calcuation: for 3: 1 squaring and 1 multiplication
- dec: full modular exponentiation
- Let's optimize decryption: I know e, d, n also p and q
  - we can compute c^d mod p and c^d mod q -> combine them with CRT
  - multiplication now become 512 bit (before 1024 bit)
  - significant computation gain. 

ElGamal
  - r = g^{k} mod p
  - c = m * y^{k} mod p
  - m = c * r^{-x} mod p
  
- encryption: we need two full modular exponentiona for encryption
  - how about precomputing r -> it's okay.
  - mush slower than RSA
- dec: full modular exponentiation
- can we use optimization?
  - remember DH stuff
  - we can choose g' -> generator in Zp*
  - p = kq + 1, g'^{k} = g
  - multiplication size much smaller.

- we can choose what to use in the situation. (Depends on what kind of computational budget.)

## RSA signature

- digitally sign with your private key.
- RSA verification cheap, but generation is expensive
- RSA no, DSA message expansion twice

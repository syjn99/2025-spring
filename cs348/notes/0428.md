## HTTP

- HTTP: Hypertext document = HTML
- stateless! (We learned this at SYN cookie - [Refer](./0326.md))
  - but everytime user have to send same request if always stateless -> we need cookie

### Cookie

- just small data, keep historical data.
- server create very small file.

### (Java)Script

- web document embeds program with JS, and web browser execute the program.

## SQL Injection

- user should request with data to log-in.
- password 체킹을 무력화
- how to prevent?
  - sanitization: carefully scan input string.
  - secure coding
    - rule of thumb: don't use user input as code.
  - parametrized queries: use secure query generator. try to use existing library

## XSS (Cross-site Script)

- `alert('XSS')` -> can be run in library server!
  - sth malicious code can run
- simple script injection attack: victim is user
  - but already prevented from modern browser
  - SOP (Same-origin Policy)
- one document contains many different sources: script, iframe, css...

### SOP

- basic access control for web browser
- 이거 다시 보자...
  - cf) CORS 다시 이해하기
  - https://developer.mozilla.org/ko/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CORS
- <protocol, host, port>
- e.g. <"https", "www.kaist.ac.kr", "80">

e.g.
- resource -> origin
- docA1: A
- scriptB: **A**
  - originally from B, but exception
  - defined by the parent.
- docA2: A
- docC: C

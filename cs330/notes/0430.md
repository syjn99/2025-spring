## Memory (Page) Sharing

- virtual memory makes it easier
- between process -> set same mapping.

## Copy-on-Write

- in the beginning of creating child process -> share same pages. (exactly same page table)
- when a process wants to modify -> copy and then remapping

[Lecture Note 9](../lecture-notes/09-file-systems.pdf)

- File is an abstraction of storage(disk)
  
## Motivation

- we can use disk, but why do we introduce file?
  - disk -> smallest unit = sector.
  - imagine read("13213123") (13213123 = sector number)
  - we can allow use symbolic name (text) -> read("abc.txt")
- we need map (file name -> sector number)
  - we already translated btw physical memory and logical memory, and it is done by OS.
- also we may use icon (Apple GUI)
